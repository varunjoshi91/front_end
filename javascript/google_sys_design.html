Edit?

There is a database / file of all seats available. You want to present them to people such that:
a person sees 10 seats at a time
no two people should see the same seats at the same time
they get 2 minutes to choose one of those seats or ask for more. If they choose one after the 2 minutes have expired, the request to buy one should fail.
We expect web clients to try to cheat by asking for seats they didn't see.
If a user asks for more seats, don't show me what you gave me a few minutes ago.
You can assume the Google login to place so we can uniquely identify user requests.
You should not let bad actors prevent the system from presenting available seats to other customers.

Describe
Where you would put the various data elements - in a database, application servers, front-ends or the browser.
What those tables or data structures would look like
How would various transactions change the data
How choices affect robustness and scalability. How do we trade off time, space and correctness?




Functional requirements:
* Network: Getting the seats, purchasing process fast enough. Web app should be fast served
* Make sure it's responsive, it's accessible, works on mobile, desktops, all devices
* 


Data structures:

type User {
  id: UIUD,
  isPresentedWithSeats = false //
}

type Concert {
  id: UIUD,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  metadata: Metadata // singer/background-singers
  seats: Seat[],
  available_seats: Seat[] 
}

type Seat {
  id: UIUD,
  taken: boolean = false
}


* Single source of truth: Data is stored in a database in the backend. Flattened, Redis 


DATA APIS:
* getUser(api_key,userId) => User
* getConcerts(api_key) => Concert[]    // Genre
* CORS, 
* getAvailableSeats(api_key, concertId, cursor) => Seat[]
  // number of seats is a constant defined on the backend
  // Cursor -> Pagination: userNeeds: 5 seats, startIndex: number, endIndex: number,
* purchaseSeats(api_key, seatsSelected[]) 

// timestamp is recorded on the backend, the first time getAvailableSeats is called, and from that we can infer, any call which is sooner than the 2 minute timeout, gets responded with a 400/500 (HTTP status code).

// cache the timestamp in memory // ttl for the cache

// API_KEy is valid, JWT token is valid

// available_seats [number_of_seats]
// user has defined the number of seats he needs

if(userSelectedSeats === numberofSeats) {
 allowToPurchase
} else {
  getAvailableSeats(_, _ 
    startIndex: 5,
   endIndex: 10 (5)
 {
  finalSeatSelection = Already_sent - onesSelected + numberOfSeats * selected

}
}


Fetching this data
* Polling every 2 minutes for refreshed seats which will be newer set of seats

  * whenever getSeats, User.isPresentedWithSeats = true // multiple sessions
    timeout (backend = 3mins) for isPresentedWithSeats = false,

HTTP2 -> multiplexing
-> bundleSplit
-> saves 


* WebSocket: constant connection
* SSE: Http2: LoadBalancer : Unidirectional

UI pov:

10 seats: 10 DOM nodes,: DOM reflows, CSS reflows, ONly updating, not adding/deleting

DOMfragment -> 10 nodes to this fragment
append document.body Once.
