QUESTION

Given two references to two DOM nodes, return the text between them.

Assume you have access to:

Node's children as an array: node.children
Node's parent: node.parentNode
Get text content of a node (naive approach): node.textContent
EXAMPLE

The output should be:

getTextBetweenNodes(node1, node2);

            The <strong>DOM</strong>&nbsp;<strong><code>Node</code></strong>&nbsp;interface is an abstract base class upon which many other DOM API objects are based, thus letting those object types to be used
            similarly and often interchangeably.
          </span>
          As an abstract class, there is no such thing as a plain <code>Node</code> object. All objects that implement <code>Node</code> functionality are based on one of its subclasses. Most notable are
          <strong><code>Document</code></strong>, <strong><code>Element</code></strong>, and <strong><code>DocumentFragment</code></strong>.

          Text that shouldn't be in the output
          In addition, every kind of DOM node is represented by an interface based on <code>Node</code>. These include <strong><code>Attr</code></strong>,
